OpenPSA Bounce Detector
=======================

The `bounce_detector.php` script is used to receive bounce messages from
the Mail Transport Agent (MTA). The bounce detector script acts as the
local delivery agent for the wildcard address configured as the bounce
address in the OpenPSA directmarketing component.

The script takes two command line arguments:

    php bounce_detector.php TEMPLATE LOGGER

The `TEMPLATE` argument is an address template like
`bounce-TOKEN@openpsa.org`. The `TOKEN` part of the template matches
any sequence of one or more characters while the rest of the template
is matched verbatim to the recipient address of the incoming message.
If the recipient address matches the template, then the `TOKEN` part is
taken as the bounce token to be logged.

The `LOGGER` argument is the URI of the bounce log file or the web
resource used for logging the detected bounce tokens. If the argument
is a file URI, then the bounce token is simply appended to the
referenced file as a new line. It is up to the implementation to process
the log file in whatever way it chooses. If the argument is an HTTP
URI, then a POST request containing the bounce token as the `token`
argument is made to that URI.

The bounce detector script will always return with success even if
there is a problem processing the message. The rationale for this is
that it is not too dangerous to accidentally lose a bounce message,
but that double-bounces are generally rather annoying. Possible error
messages are written to standard output to be stored by the MTA that
invokes the script.

Postfix and qmail configuration
-------------------------------

The bounce detector can be used as a drop-in tool in Postfix `aliases`
or `.forward` files or in qmail `.qmail-default` files. Just configure
a wildcard address and define the bounce detector script to process all
messages to that address. The script only expects that the `RECIPIENT`
environment variable contains the full SMTP envelope recipient address.
