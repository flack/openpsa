     *   successful form processing. The form has already been validated, synchronized with and
     *   saved to the data source.
     * - <i>cancel</i> the user cancelled the form processing, no I/O has been done.
     * - <i>edit</i>, <i>previous</i>, <i>next</i> indicates that the form is not yet successfully
     *   completed. This can mean many things, including validation errors, which the renderer
     *   already outlines in the Form output. No I/O processing has been done.
     *
     * The form will be automatically validated for 'save' and 'next', but not for 'previous'.
     *
     * Normally, all validation should be done during the Form processing, but sometimes this is
     * not possible. These are the cases where type validation rules fail instead of form validation
     * ones. At this time, the integration of type validation is rudimentary and will
     * transparently return edit instead of validation.
     *
     * Note, that this call does not actually execute the save call to the datamanager, there
     * is nothing to save at this point.
     *
     * @return string One of 'save', 'cancel', 'next', 'previous', 'edit', depending on the schema
     *     configuration.
