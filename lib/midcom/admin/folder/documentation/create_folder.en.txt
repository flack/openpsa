Creating folders
====

* _URL name_ is name of the target. Through this name it is possible to define, which URL refers to the currently created folder. You are not required to enter the _URL name_, as the system will automatically generate the missing _URL name_ from the _Title_.
  - _URL name_ should be lower case ASCII (a-z, 0-9) and has to be without breaks; a good practice is to replace spaces with slash -.
* _Title_ is the name, which will be shown in the navigation.
* _Folder type_ is the selection for [MidCOM components|component]. You will be offered the same type of the component as the parent is as a default, but - depending on the installation - there are usually many different functionalities, such as
  - News feed (_net.nehmer.blog_)
  - Photo gallery (_org.openpsa.slideshow_)
  - Sitemap (_de.linkm.sitemap_)
* _Style template_ can be used to define the way content will be presented. Style templates are almost always customized to the needs of the site and you should be informed by your site manager if there is any need for using customized templates.
* _Order of navigation items_ is to choose the navigational order. This can be left to _default sort order_.
* finally click on _Create_
