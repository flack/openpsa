[OpenPSA](http://midgard-project.org/openpsa/) is a management suite for web agencies and consultants that provides a unified interface for handling many common business processes. It is built on a component architecture that makes it easy to integrate new components for specific requirements and is available as free software under the terms of the LGPL license.

OpenPSA 1.x was initially released as Open Source under the GNU GPL license by [Nemein](http://nemein.com/) on May 8th 2004 to support the [5th anniversary](http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/midgard-5th-anniversary.html) of the [Midgard Project](http://www.midgard-project.org/). The package was originally known as Nemein.Net.

The currently active branch (OpenPSA 9) is developed and supported by [CONTENT CONTROL](http://www.contentcontrol-berlin.de/).

## Setting up a Midgard server

You need a Midgard database set up for OpenPSA usage. This can be generated by running:

    $ php quick_init.php openpsa

You need `php-cgi` (typically at `/etc/php5/cgi/conf.d/midgard2.ini`) with some settings that open a Midgard2 database connection:

    extension=midgard2.so

    [midgard2]
    midgard.engine = On
    midgard.http = On
    midgard.configuration_file="/etc/midgard2/conf.d/openpsa"
    midgard.superglobals_compat = On

Next you should install OpenPSA under your document root:

    $ cp -R openpsa /var/www/

## Setting up Lighttpd

Enable `rewrite` and `fastcgi` modules in your Lighttpd config (by default `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf`):

    server.modules += (
        "mod_fastcgi",
        "mod_rewrite"
    )

Also enable FastCGI to talk to your PHP installation:

    fastcgi.server = ( 
        ".php" => (
            (
                "bin-path" => "/usr/bin/php-cgi",
                "socket" => "/tmp/php.socket"
            )
        )
    )

Then just configure your Lighttpd to pass all requests to the OpenPSA "rootfile":

    url.rewrite-once = ( 
        "^/openpsa2-static/OpenPsa2/(.*)$" => "/openpsa/themes/OpenPsa2/static/$1",
        "^/openpsa2-static/(.*)$" => "/openpsa/static/$1",
        "^([^\?]*)(\?(.+))?$" => "openpsa/rootfile.php$2"
    )

*Note:* this rewrite rule is a bit too inclusive, to be improved.

Restart your Lighttpd and point your browser to the address you're using with the server. Default login to OpenPSA is `admin`/`password`.

## Setting up Apache

Alternatively, you can also run under Apache (or any other web server, for that matter). Just make sure that you have mod_rewrite enabled:

    a2enmod rewrite

And use something like this in your vhost config (or .htaccess file):

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/midcom-static/OpenPsa2/(.*)$ /openpsa/themes/OpenPsa2/static/$1 [L]
    RewriteRule ^/midcom-static/(.*)$ /openpsa/static/$1 [L]
    RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ /openpsa/rootfile.php [QSA,L]
